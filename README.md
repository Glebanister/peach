# peach üçë

## Status

In development at this moment.

## What is it

The main idea - create a lightweight scripting language with C++17, that can be
extended by user. All scripts can be evaluated in your program runtime.
What means extandable? For example, it already has integer numbers, so when you type `var = 239`, in C++ it equals to `std::int32_t var = 239`.
You may want to have 64 bit integer, so you are able to tell peach, that
`var = 239ll` means `std::int_64_t var = 239ll`. Same with floating
point numbers.

## Where can you use it

### Binding with your C++ code

First of all, this is my pet project, so i am not sure if someone
ever will use it, but i know where it can be used. For example,
you have graphical application, that every tick reads some integer array
from text file, then draws graph based on this numbers. But numbers need to be processed, for example, you don't want picture anomalies.
So you write peach script for processing each number, for example:

```c++
extern data_unit
return data_unit < 10 or data_unit > 100
```

Now, when your application is already running, you are able to
change ***logic*** of number cut, in other words, in runtime you simply
can change code to:

```c++
extern data_unit
good = 0
for (i = 2; i < 10; ++i):
    good += data_unit % i == 0
return good > 2
```

This is just an example, it makes no sense.

### Writing actual scripts with it

Use peach interpreter to evaluate your scripts from console:

```python
# main.pch

for (i = 0; i < 2; i += 1):
    print("Hello, World!")
```

```bash
$ peach main.pch
Hello, World!Hello, World!
```

## Syntax example

***Warning***: work is not done yet, so isn't final version.

```python
res = 4
i = 0
while (res != 0)
    i = i + 1
    res = res - 1
    if i % 2 == 0:
        res = res + a + b + i
    elif i % 2 == 1:
        res = 0
    else:
        res = res + c - i
res += c
```
